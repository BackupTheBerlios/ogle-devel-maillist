Maybe this is worth benchmarking.  Byteswapping can happen quite often.
I don't see a bit of ASM as a problem, it's just a few lines...

&gt;<i> The audio/subp_control is a bit problematic.

</I>&gt;<i> An alternative would be to create macros to get at the bits instead,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A third alt is to define just the audio/subp_control_t types in the .h file
</I>&gt;<i> and cast the uint16_t to the new types when you want to use the
</I>&gt;<i> bitfields.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or make a #define before including dvdread.h with something like
</I>&gt;<i> #define DVDREAD_NEW_CONTROL_INTERFACE if you want the new bitfields,
</I>&gt;<i> this alternative is probably just ugly.
</I>
The comments in the source indicate that a new type was desirable, now
you have it...

&gt;<i> Any comments on this. Is it worth breaking source compatibility for
</I>&gt;<i> just these bitfields in this release?
</I>
What about the next release? :)

&gt;<i> Are you sure the control/mapping field should always be decoded the
</I>&gt;<i> same way so we don't have to change the bitfields later on?
</I>&gt;<i> Using macros would help in that case.
</I>
No, it's not my patch.  Shall I try contacting the patch sender?

Diego
