I was planning on doing the release this weekend...

About your patches:
The asm patch will probably not go in. Nothing in libdvdread is so
time critical to need it so I'd rather not have any asm in there.

The audio/subp_control is a bit problematic. 
At the moment you have access to the data but only as a uint16_t
that you have to pick out the bits from yourself.
The patch would mean breaking source compatibility.

An alternative would be to create macros to get at the bits instead,
but maybe not as nice.

A third alt is to define just the audio/subp_control_t types in the .h file
and cast the uint16_t to the new types when you want to use the
bitfields.

Or make a #define before including dvdread.h with something like
#define DVDREAD_NEW_CONTROL_INTERFACE if you want the new bitfields,
this alternative is probably just ugly.


Any comments on this. Is it worth breaking source compatibility for
just these bitfields in this release?

Are you sure the control/mapping field should always be decoded the
same way so we don't have to change the bitfields later on?
Using macros would help in that case.
