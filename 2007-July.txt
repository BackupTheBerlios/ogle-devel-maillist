Subject: [Ogle-devel] Nasty regression in dvdread since removal of getbits()
	in nav_read.c
Message-ID: <46ACD1C7.3080408@email.it>

Hi,
since nav_read.c was changed to use conditional bitfields rather than 
calls to getbits()
that file is completely broken: the C standard doesn't guarantee how 
bitfields should
be laid out in memory (and additionally to me those 2 different layout 
-e.g. in btni_t-
seem to be defined incorrectly) making this "feature" too much dipendent 
on the
compiler and endiannes used.

The result is that the navigation is completely broken, as you
can verify yourself when compiling my fork of dvdnav against dvdread 
0.9.4+.
(svn co svn://dvdnav.mplayerhq.hu/dvdnav )

May I ask you why you did it ? :-)     
saving code is nice, but not at the cost of correctness.
Can you please revert that change and restore the original code?

Moreover, where can I access the cvs of dvdread? I need to keep
track of the single changes.

Thanks a lot,
    Nico
