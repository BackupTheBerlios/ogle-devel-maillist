Is this error message optimal? I the device access needed for more  
than css auth? Then the error should be from libdvdcss?

See http://bugs.debian.org/347276 for the whole conversation.

Subject: [Ogle-devel] [PATCH] DVD subpicture/audio stream mapping
Message-ID: <20060118233418.GA11287@biurrun.de>

Hi,

this patch was submitted in August 2005 to MPlayer.  It was applied with
slight modifications, please review and maybe apply it to libdvdread.
The patch is attached, the message the author sent is pasted below.

Regards

Diego

Hi all!

I had to realise that mplayer entirely ignores the logical mapping info 
between the various dvd audio/subtitle tracks and the corresponding mpeg 
streams, and does an identity mapping instead.
But I guess it's because libdvdread lacks the support for it :)
So here is the patch that fixes this shortcoming...

Some background info:
The audio and subtitle streams as specified in the IFO do not correspond
one-to-one to the streams in the mpeg-ps, but there is a mapping table
which specifies the assignments. In case of audio this hasn't been a big
problem unless the dvd has been really screwed up, because there are
the same number of logical streams as mpeg streams. So maybe you have a
0->1, 1->0 mapping in which case selecting one language in mplayer gets
you the other soundtrack, but both tracks are accessible.

Subtitles are not so simple however, because for one logical stream you
can have multiple mpeg subpicture streams. If you create a dvd for a
16:9 movie, you have to specify a spu stream for 4:3 letterboxed display
and also for 16:9 widescreen display. Up to this time I have run across
only one dvd which did not map the same stream to both modes. So not a
frequent case, but until now mplayer could not display the subtitles
correctly for these dvds, because it considered logical stream N to map
to mpeg stream N. But in this case the mapping is e.g. lang1->{0,1}
lang2->{2,3}, so when selecting lang1 mplayer would play lang1 stream
for letterbox, and when selecting lang2, it would play lang1 stream for
widescreen. The lang2 sub would be totally inaccessible, even with -sid,
because the code ignores values higher than the maximum number of subs.

So if you had problems like this, hopefully this will fix it. Patch is
against the last CVS snapshot accessible from the webpage (20050806).

Regards,
Lehel

And this time with a patch that actually applies cleanly to libdvdread
CVS.  Apologies for testing everybody's patience so much..

Hey,

what is the status of the new release that we've been hearing about?

If it's not too pressing I'd ask you to postpone the release a bit more,
after the two patches I just posted I could fish out a few more bits out
of our local diff.

I was planning on doing the release this weekend...

About your patches:
The asm patch will probably not go in. Nothing in libdvdread is so
time critical to need it so I'd rather not have any asm in there.

The audio/subp_control is a bit problematic. 
At the moment you have access to the data but only as a uint16_t
that you have to pick out the bits from yourself.
The patch would mean breaking source compatibility.

An alternative would be to create macros to get at the bits instead,
but maybe not as nice.

A third alt is to define just the audio/subp_control_t types in the .h file
and cast the uint16_t to the new types when you want to use the
bitfields.

Or make a #define before including dvdread.h with something like
#define DVDREAD_NEW_CONTROL_INTERFACE if you want the new bitfields,
this alternative is probably just ugly.


Any comments on this. Is it worth breaking source compatibility for
just these bitfields in this release?

Are you sure the control/mapping field should always be decoded the
same way so we don't have to change the bitfields later on?
Using macros would help in that case.

Compiles fine here (Solaris 10 U1/sparc, Sun Studio 11.0).. I'll test it 
tonight.

Thanks Bjorn! :)

It does work, on Solaris 10 U1 x86, Studio 11.
Built in 32 bit only so far.

And the slowness problem I was having with Ogle seems to have 
disappeared... Good!

Maybe this is worth benchmarking.  Byteswapping can happen quite often.
I don't see a bit of ASM as a problem, it's just a few lines...

The comments in the source indicate that a new type was desirable, now
you have it...

What about the next release? :)

No, it's not my patch.  Shall I try contacting the patch sender?

You don't have to, I'm on the list :)

And yes, this is a fixed structure, there should be no worries about that.

At worst it can be included in the next major release (1.0?), then it 
wouldn't be a problem breaking source compatibility.
