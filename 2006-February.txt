About v1.0...
Anyone have any info on the differences in dvd structures in 
DVD-VR, DVD+VR, DVD+RW video formats compared to DVD-Video
and should support for them (if the info is available) be included
before v1.0 ?

I haven't looked to deeply into this, but as I understand there are
some compatability problems when reading dvd+/-r(w) discs made
in standalone dvd recorders (especially if the disc sessions haven't been
closed / finalized).
