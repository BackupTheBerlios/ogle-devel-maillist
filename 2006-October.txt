Subject: [Ogle-devel] libdvdread-0.9.7 released (bugfix only)
Message-ID: <20061006091958.GA17087@dtek.chalmers.se>

There was an erroneous free in the DVDClose function that
triggered a segfault in case more than one DVDClose was called (after
calling more than one DVDOpen.
This is fixed in the new 0.9.7 release of libdvdread.

Subject: [Ogle-devel] strange behavior of DVDFileStat
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0610261929530.30827@grozny.maths.univ-evry.fr>


Hello,

I'm writing a small gtk gui that try to list the content of a DVD. I use 
the filestat.c code for that part. With a DVDROM, file stat returns:

VIDEO_TS.IFO: size: 12288
VIDEO_TS.VOB: size: 165888
VIDEO_TS.BUP: size: 12288
VTS_01_0.IFO: size: 94208
VTS_01_0.VOB: size: 420061184
VTS_01_[1-9].VOB: size: 7239475200, [1073489920], [1073442816], 
[1073612800], [1073672192], [1073225728], [1073483776], [798547968]
VTS_01_0.BUP: size: 94208

which is perfect. But with my gui, everything is good, except when I try 
to get the stats of the DVD_READ_TITLE_VOBS domain. I get:

for the size: 2944507904 (should be 7239475200)
for the number of titles: 1 (should be 7)

I don't undersand at all, as I mimic the filestat code. Sometimes the 
program seg fault (gdb is of no help, as it returns no useful 
informations, even with stepping), sometimes, gtk returns an internal 
problem, sometimes no problem except the wrong values.

I fear a corruption of the memory, but I don't know where. There might be 
a bug in my program too.

I've attached the prog. Just run make to compile it. The main code is in 
gvob_main_window.c (_gvob_player_selected_cb function, line 35)

Can someone tell me if there's a bug in my implementation, or if there's a 
known bug with libdvdread / gtk, or something else ?

thank you very much

Subject: [Ogle-devel] War on magic numbers
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0610282022110.27792@kahlo.cs.duke.edu>


    Too many places in the codebase have "magic numbers": hard-coded 
constants that should really be replaced with #define'd values or 
enum'ed values.  A few questions:

o do you prefer #define'd values or enums?

o should I create a separete dvdread/constants.h or should I place the 
values in the header file that matches the .c file in which they're 
contained (e.g., FPS_2500 and FPS_2997 go in ifo_print.h or should I put 
everything in *_types.h?

o what is the patch submission process?

Thanks.
