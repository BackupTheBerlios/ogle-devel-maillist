The problem is that libdvdread is compiled with large file support
(CFLAGS = -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64)
and your program is not so off_t/size_t and so on may have different sizes.

You also use the size values in the dvd_stat_t as int when they infact
are off_t.

Your get_size() function returns an int but the size of buf.size is off_t.

Set your CFLAGS to largefile support as above.
Handle the sizes as off_t not int (off_t is probably 64 bit when compiled for
largefile).
Change your treestore to support off_t or use some type that can handle 64bit
gint64 perhaps.
And change your printfs to print 64bit numbers instead of 32 (%ld -> %lld
depending on your platform).
Now everything should work.

Hope this helps.

For these things probably #defines if you don't have a particular reason
to use enums.

Things that has to do with fields in ifo_types.h should go in ifo_types.h
like video_format in video_attr_t:
#define  xxxx_VIDEO_FORMAT_NTSC 0
#define  xxxx_VIDEO_FORMAT_PAL 1

Things that are internal to libdvdread should not be put in the
installed header files.

There should be a naming scheme. We need a prefix for the defines
in installed header files. Instead of only VIDEO_FORMAT_NTSC it should
probably be called DVDREAD_VIDEO_FORMAT_NTSC or something like that.

Send the patches to the ogle-devel list.
(Keep them small, don't submit unrelated changes in the same patch,
everything should compile after each patch is applied)

Hey,

indeed, that was the problem. It works very well, now.

thank you very much :)

Here's the first patch that creates the named constants for IFO data
using #define's.  Let me know if any names should be changed.
